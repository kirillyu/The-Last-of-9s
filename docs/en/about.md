# About

**The Last of 9s** is an engineering blog where I share my experience and approaches on how to build processes from scratch and solve applied tasks around my favorite aspects of systems:

*   **Observability:** How to extract maximum value from the most common signals.
*   **Performance:** Where time is lost.
*   **Reliability:** Architecture and processes that don't crash (or crash gracefully).

## Briefly about me

10+ years in the industry (Telecom, Banking, Retail, Startups). Journey from Load Testing Engineer to Tech Lead and Acting CIO.

*   **Production Experience:** Improved a major e-commerce SLA from one nine to three, personally resolving 400+ critical incidents.
*   **Processes:** Implemented Incident Management, Error Budgets, SLO, Capacity Planning, and FinOps from scratch.
*   **Engineering:** Wrote a custom load testing framework and implemented Performance Testing as a Service.
*   **Education:** Conference speaker, mentor for performance and SRE communities.
*   **Current:** Customer Reliability Technical Lead at VictoriaMetrics.
