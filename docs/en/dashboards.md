# Dashboards

Grafana dashboards are grouped by signal and system layer. This page is a vault for live panels,
snapshots, and short runbook notes.

## Notes

- Some dashboards will be embedded live once public.
- If a dashboard is private, expect a static snapshot with annotations.
- Every dashboard comes with a brief runbook.
